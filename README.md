# KiDGrad ( Using Kinect in Skeleton Detection for Graph Drawing)



The system on which KiDGraD is developed has the following features. 
The operating system of the computer is Microsoft Windows 7. 
To use Kinect several software were needed to be installed including Windows SDK version 1.7 
for Kinect and Kinect driver provided by Microsoft. 
To write the codes of KiDGraD, we used C\# as the programming language and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 as the programming IDE. 


This program is written by [Sahar Mehrpour](http://mason.gmu.edu/~smehrpou/) and Yeganeh Bahoo.
